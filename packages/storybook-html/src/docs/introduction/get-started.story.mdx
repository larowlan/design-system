There are a few ways to get started with the UQ Design System. Which method you
choose depends on your project's requirements and whether you're a designer, an
analyst, or a developer. **Please note that we are still working on various
solutions to suit a variety of project needs.**

Here are the ways you can start using the UQ Design System right now;
- If you have prior experience with npm and Sass, [use the npm CLI to install components](#using-npm-to-install-components-into-your-project).
- If you don't have previous experience with npm or Sass, please [contact us at ADS-UI][2] for further options.
- Designers can go straight to the docs to view working examples. Also, check out the [Future Students Design System][3] (Figma project).
- If you would like a walkthrough of the docs for your analysis needs, please [contact us][2] for a tour.

## Reading the docs
Reading the documentation is an integral part of implementing the Design System. It's where we provide:
- HTML snippets,
- JavaScript & Sass library docs,
- and guidance via standards, patterns, and systems.

## Using npm to install components into your project

> Our packages are NOT hosted on the [npm public registry][4]. Please see the
> warning at the top of this page. We will provide instructions on how to set up
> your environment when we release the packages publicly.

Design System packages are scoped under `@uqds`.

For example, to install buttons:

```shell
npm i @uqds/button
```

See the [following list of package names](#component-package-list).

## General package structure

Subject to change.

### Sass library

Non-emitting code: `@uqds/{component}/src/scss/_global.scss`. Doesn't result in
any compiled CSS by itself when processed. The `@uqds/core` package is an
example of a package that only contains non-emitting code.

Emitting code: `@uqds/{component}/src/scss/_component.scss`. Results in compiled
CSS when processed.

### JavaScript library

Coming soon.
