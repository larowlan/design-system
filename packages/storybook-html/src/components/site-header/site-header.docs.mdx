  <Story height="350px" id="components-site-header--site-header" />
</Canvas>

### Site title

The site title component includes the repsonsive open/close menu button on smaller devices

### Site navigation

Requires the Site Title component for the Responsive menu botton.

## Site utility

This is not an advertising or spam section, but intended for discrete, site wide functionality.

**Examples include:**

* UQ Maps, expand to fill whole screen
* UQ researchers shortlist
