<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story height={170} id="components-blockquote--blockquote-dark" />
</Canvas>

```html
<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote--dark">
    <div class="blockquote__body">
        <p>Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly — they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="blockquote__footer">
        <p>Aldous Huxley, <cite><a href="#" class="blockquote__link">Brave New World</a></cite></p>
    </div>
</blockquote>
```

## How and when to use
The quoted content is contained in the ```blockquote``` element, and the author and source are placed outside that element so they do not become a part of the quoted content. If referencing the source of the quote, the title of the source should be placed in a ```cite``` element. This element should only contain the source not the author as the author is not considered the source according to the specifcations of the ```cite``` element. If no author or source is required, the ```figcaption``` element can be omitted.
