## JavaScript package registries

A JavaScript package registry is a JavaScript software-package hosting service.
For example,

- AWS CodeArtifact
- NPM.org (serves as the default for proxy registries)
- Github packages etc.

Packages in these registries are in CommonJS format and include a metadata file
in JSON format (`package.json`).

### Why JavaScript packages?

## Running Verdaccio

Verdaccio is a local npm registry proxy that we can use to play with publishing
packages from the design system. By default, this (mono)repo is set to publish
to the default Verdaccio local server address (http://localhost:4873/).

> **ðŸš¨ Before continuing, please [fork][1] the UQDS monorepo â€” as 
> `npx lerna publish` will create tags on the repo.**

### Set up Verdaccio for local package publication

Set up Verdaccio globally:
```shell
$ npm i -g verdaccio
```

Run Verdaccio:  
```shell
$ verdaccio
```

Your registry should now be running. You may need to create a user account
during this step as well. For instructions, navigate the Verdaccio
local server address (http://localhost:4873/ by default).

ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: you must configure the monorepo's `lerna.json` file to point your
local registry server, i.e.:

```json
"command": {
  "publish": {
    "registry": "http://localhost:4873/"
  }
}
```

With Verdaccio still running, publish the packages using the Lerna `publish`
command.

```shell
$ npx lerna publish
```

Follow the instructions to bump your package versions.

Voila! You have now published the packages to a registry.

## Consuming the packages you've published

You can do this step in an existing project or start a new project. Doing as
little as running `npm init` or as much as using [*Create React App*][3] to
scaffold your new project is up to you.

Firstly, you will need to configure the `registry` setting in an [`.npmrc`][2]
file (located at the root of your project or you have to create it) like below.

```
# .npmrc
registry=http://localhost:4873/
```

Once this is done, you can install packages as you normally would, e.g.
`npm i @uqds/accordion`.
